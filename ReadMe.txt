*Comparison of AB Test and Conversion of Bidding Methods*


1. Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type 
called 'maximum bidding'. One of our customers has decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test 
to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and now 
x.com is waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for our 
customer is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.


2. Story of Dataset

In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number 
of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data 
sets, the control and test groups. These datasets are on separate pages of ab_testing.xlsxexcel. Maximum Bidding 
was applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.


3. Variables of Dataset

Impression: Ad views
Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad
Purchase: The number of products purchased after the ads clicked
Earning: Earnings after purchased products

Task 2: Defining A/B Test Hypothesis
	
	Step 1: Defining Hypothesis
	Step 2: Analyzing the purchase averages for the control and test group


Task 3: Performing Hypothesis Testing
